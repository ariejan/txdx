TxDx uses plain text files with Todo.txt formatted items. Steps to verify:

 1. Download https://gitlab.devroom.io/ariejan/txdx/-/blob/master/example.txt
 2. Start TxDx
 3. Settings -> File Settings -> Todot.txt file -> Select File
 4. Go 'Back' to see results.

The `Archive.txt file` is optional, but you may create an empty archive.txt file
and select it in Settings.
