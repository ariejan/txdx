TxDx needs a directory to work with. Simply create a new folder on your Desktop (or somewhere
else). 

 - Start TxDx
 - Click the "Select your TxDx folder" button.
 - Navigate to the directory you created and click 'Choose'
 - That's all. You can add new items by click the + at the top right or using CMD-N
